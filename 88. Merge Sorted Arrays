        Merge nums1 and nums2 into a single array sorted in non-decreasing order.
        
        Problem Description:
        - nums1 has length m+n with the first m elements being the elements to merge
        - nums2 has length n with elements to merge into nums1
        - nums1 has enough space at the end to hold all elements from nums2
        
        Example:
        - nums1 = [1,2,3,0,0,0], m = 3
        - nums2 = [2,5,6], n = 3
        - After merge: nums1 = [1,2,2,3,5,6]
        
        Approach:
        - Work from the end of both arrays to avoid overwriting elements in nums1
        - Use three pointers:
          - i: points to the last valid element in nums1
          - j: points to the last element in nums2
          - k: points to the current position to fill in nums1
        
        Do not return anything, modify nums1 in-place instead.

        # Initialize pointers:
        i = m - 1      # Last valid element in nums1
        j = n - 1      # Last element in nums2
        k = m + n - 1  # Last position in the merged array
        
        # Continue until we've processed all elements from nums2
        while j >= 0:
            # If there are still elements in nums1 and the current nums1 element
            # is greater than the current nums2 element
            if i >= 0 and nums1[i] > nums2[j]:
                # Place the larger element (from nums1) at position k
                nums1[k] = nums1[i]
                # Move to the previous element in nums1
                i = i - 1
            else:
                # Either nums1 is exhausted (i < 0) or the current nums2 element
                # is greater than or equal to the current nums1 element
                # Place the element from nums2 at position k
                nums1[k] = nums2[j]
                # Move to the previous element in nums2
                j = j - 1
            
            # Move to the previous position in the merged array
            k = k - 1
            
        # Note: We don't need to handle any remaining elements in nums1
        # because they are already in their correct positions
